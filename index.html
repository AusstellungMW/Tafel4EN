On April 11, 1945, units of the U.S. 9th Army reached Wolfenbüttel Prison. Shortly before the arrival of the American troops, the prison staff had fled, abandoning approximately 1,500 inmates. The soldiers encountered chaotic conditions within the facility. The prisoners were emaciated, and many were seriously ill. Due to severe overcrowding, lack of medical care, and a dysentery epidemic, the death toll had risen drastically in the months leading up to the prison’s liberation.

The situation was especially dire for those inmates who had been transferred back from the external labor camps in Wesendorf, Blankenburg, and Halberstadt.

"There was a widespread dysentery epidemic with several hundred cases. In one room […] around 200 prisoners were crammed together, particularly Italians and Poles. They were all gravely ill."
— Testimony of Dr. Walter Kalthöner, August 24, 1945

After securing control of the prison, the American soldiers unlocked the prisoners’ cells. Initially, they were not allowed to leave the premises. In a desperate state, the starving men immediately raided the prison’s food supplies. Several hundred inmates seized the opportunity to escape. Over the following weeks, the Allies released the majority of the prisoners. However, those convicted of crimes still considered criminal under postwar law—such as theft, fraud, and same-sex relations between men—remained incarcerated.

Some political prisoners voluntarily stayed behind. They assisted the Allied forces and temporarily took on organizational duties within the prison.

In June 1945, the British took over the administration of the still-operational prison. Around the same time, the British military government began gradually reinstating former prison staff while simultaneously launching investigations into the actions of certain prison officials.
